BattleBoard project done individually by Alson Lor.

Additional Feature:

At the end of the game, the program asks the user if they want to play again. If they do, brings the program back to the start of the game
where they can select standard or expert mode again. Otherwise the program terminates.

To run and compile the code:

1.) Open up the location of Main.java and Board.java in the terminal.

2.) Type the command "javac Board.java". This should compile the program which consists of the methods that allow the game to function.

3.) Type the command "javac Main.java". This should compile the program which the user interacts with.

4.) Next type the command "java Main". This should run the program and allow you to play the BattleBoard game.

Known bugs or defects:

There are no known bugs or defects in the program.
